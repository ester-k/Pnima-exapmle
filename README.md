# Pnima-exapmle

In this wordpress site (https://pnimatv.co.il/),
I built an integration for registration and customer login.
I uploaded two files:

* php  function-crm - listen to ajaxs call,auth functions, integration to Zebra crm.
example to add tv-focues (add subscibe)
ajax name: "add_tv_focus"
* js select-type.js ajax call after the customer registers by registration form. (line 23)
* php single-tv - UI.
